###Scripting\
The VBA scripting was tested first on the alphabetical_testingdlm excel sheet \
The final VBA scripting was successfully implemented after trial and error, with the multiple_year_stock_dlm2 excel data\
\
Multiple counters and for statements were established to count Ticker data, row data, etc. through each worksheet (ws).  If/Else loops were used to determine data for yearly change, percent change, total stock volume, and the bonus great percent decrease/increase and volume.  \
